## Responsive Portfolio:

This is my professional portfolio site containing a home page, contact page and portfolio page.

There is a small selection about me on the home page to introduce myself. I also added an image to allow the user to put a picture with the page. The home page also includes a card with links to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub page. There is also a link to a PDF file of my resume that can be viewed.

The responsive nav bar allows to users to open a contact page with a quick note to encourage users to network with me and a quick access card with links to my Github, LinkedIn profiles, email address and phone contact.

The users can also open a portfolio page which displays a few projects and homework assignments. These projects have a screenshot of the application with a quick description of the application. Languages used, a link to my GitHub repo and a link to the deployed application. I hope to continue to add more projects to my porfolio as I continue to advance my coding and web development skills.

Being that I don't have a lot of information and materials to fill the entire screens landscape at this point, I used a card to create a bar that includes responsive icon links to my home page, LinkedIn and Github accounts, to draw attention to the main content on each page and help fill space.

As the screen is minimized into a smaller layout the content in responsive and renders on a variety of screen sizes.
