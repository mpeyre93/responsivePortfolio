## Responsive Portfolio:

This is my professional portfolio site containing a home page, contact page and portfolio project page.

The home page includes my education and an about me section. There are quick links to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub page and a link to a PDF file of my resume that can be viewed.

The responsive nav bar allows to users to open a contact page to see a brief display of work history and a contact form. Users can access links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles. They can also see my email address and phone number to contact if they need to connect or have a question.

Users can navigate to the portfolio page which displays a few group projects and personal projects. These projects have a screenshot of the application with a quick description of the app. Languages used, a link to my GitHub repo and a link to the deployed application are also displayed. I hope to continue to add more projects to my porfolio as I continue to advance my coding and web development skills.
