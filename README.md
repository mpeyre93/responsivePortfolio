CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive portfolio site containing a home page, contact page and portfolio page.

There is a small selection about me on the home page to introduce myself. I also added an image to allow the user to put a picture with the page.
The responsive nav bar allows to users to open a contact page with a quick note to encourage users to network with me and a quick access card with links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles.
The users can also open a portfolio page with place holder images that I hope to fill with my work as I grow and learn as a new developer.
Being that I don't have a lot of information and materials to fill the entire screens landscape at this point, I used a card to create a bar that includes responsive icon links to my home page, LinkedIn and Github accounts, to draw attention to the main content on each page and help fill space. 
As the screen is minimized into a smaller layout the content in responsive and renders on a variety of screen sizes.
